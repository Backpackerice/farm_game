Blue-sky random ideas for the game

- Multiple modes where you play as different types of actor:
    - policy decision makers (this is the current game)
    - one farmer (decide what to plant, where to sell it)
    - processors
    - distributer
    - retailer
    - consumer
- When you take on a role, the computer takes over everyone else
    - different perspectives, different measures highlighted
- do you control one member of the class or many members? both as options?


- Ability to change choices far back in time


- All interventions should start with values that indicate the status quo
    - people said "oh, it's already at {x}" rather than realizing they'd put it there by clicking on the intervention
- It wasn't clear that clicking on a new intervention makes time go forward
    - So all interventions should start at time=0, and maybe have parameters
      as to how long they last for
        - no restriction of 1 intervention per time step
    - Clicking on an intervention just changes what you're looking at (like tabs)
    - No stacking of the same intervention
- When you make a change, see how it'll affect the future
    - (annoying to have to click on 'do nothing' over and over)

    
- Use laptops with large displays!
